    "The goal of this midterm is to give you the opportunity to test out some of the skills that you've developed thus far this semester. In particular, you'll reflect on what you know about writing code using Python and showcase some of your new programming skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important note about using online resources:** This exam is \"open internet\". That means that you can look up documentation, google how to accomplish certain Python tasks, etc. Being able to effectively use the internet for computational modeling and data science is a very important skill, so we want to make sure you have the opportunity to exercise that skill. **However, the use of any person-to-person communication software is absolutely not acceptable.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do your own work.** This midterm is designed to give you the opportunity to show the instructor what you can do and you should hold yourself accountable for maintaining a high level of academic integrity. Any violation of academic integrity could result in you receiving a zero on the midterm.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to look through the entire exam before you get started so that you can appropriately budget your time and understand the broad goals of the exam.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions during the exam, you may ask the instructor, the TA, or the LA privately; simply raise your hand and one of us will come over to you. \n",

    "1. Finally, to test that everything is working, \"git push\" the file so that it ends up in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: Double check you've added your Professor and your TA as collaborators to your \"turnin\" respository (you should have done this in the previous homework assignment).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also important**: Make sure that the version of this notebook that you are working on is the same one that you just added to your repository! If you are working on a different copy of the noteobok, **none of your changes will be tracked**!\n",

    "The file should now show up on your GitHub account in the `cmse202-S23-turnin` repository inside the `midterm` directory you just created.  Periodically, **you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location**. It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification.\n",
